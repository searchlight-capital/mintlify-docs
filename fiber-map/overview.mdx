## What is the Fiber Map Dataset?

The Fiber Map dataset provides comprehensive broadband availability data sourced from the **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** broadband reporting program. This data captures internet service provider coverage across the United States, including provider names, technology types, and service speeds at the location level.

### Coverage

- **Data Size**: 2.5+ billion location records across multiple time periods
- **Geographic Scope**: US-wide data collection
- **Current Focus**: Indiana (Gold layer contains 2% sample filtered to Indiana)
- **Time Range**: June 2022 through December 2024
- **Update Frequency**: Semi-annual (June and December releases)

## Key Business Use Cases

The Fiber Map dataset enables several critical business analyses:

  Access pre-built visualizations and interactive analysis tools
</Card>

Lightdash provides:
- Pre-configured metrics and dimensions
- Interactive filtering by provider, technology, time period, and geography
- Export capabilities for further analysis
- No SQL knowledge required

### Query Directly in Snowflake

For advanced users who need direct database access:

**Database**: `FIBER_MAP`  
**Primary Tables**:
- `DBT_GOLD.USA_ALL_PERIODS_FINAL` - Detailed location-level data
- `DBT_GOLD.USA_LOCATION_SUMMARY` - Aggregated summary view

<Note>
For most analytical queries, use **Lightdash** instead of writing SQL directly. Lightdash provides pre-built metrics, interactive filtering, and visualizations without requiring SQL knowledge.

## Understanding the Data

### Core Concepts

**Location ID**: The fundamental grain of the data. Each `LOCATION_ID` represents a unique broadband service location (typically a building or address).

**Technology Codes**: Broadband services are classified by technology type (Fiber, Cable, Fixed Wireless, Satellite, Copper/DSL).

**Time Periods**: Data is captured semi-annually and labeled by month/year (e.g., "June 2023", "December 2023").

**Business vs. Residential**: Services are tagged with codes indicating availability to business customers (B), residential customers (R), or both (X).

### Data Layers

The Fiber Map project follows a four-layer architecture:

1. **CLEAN**: Raw data from FCC reporting (source of truth)
2. **STAGE**: Standardized column names and data types (not typically used by analysts)
3. **MODEL**: Normalized business entities with analytical fields (not typically used by analysts)
4. **GOLD**: Analysis-ready datasets optimized for business use ← **Start here!**

<Tip>
**For most analysis needs, start with the GOLD layer tables.** These are specifically designed for business users and include all necessary fields with clear, readable names.
</Tip>

## Data Quality & Reliability

This data comes from **provider self-reporting to the FCC**, which means:

- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of regulated broadband providers
- ✅ Standardized reporting format across all providers
- ⚠️ Data represents claimed availability, not verified service or actual customer connections
- ⚠️ Updates occur only twice per year, so recent changes may not be reflected

<Warning>
Always interpret this data as "claimed service availability" rather than guaranteed service. Actual service availability at specific addresses may differ.
</Warning>
