## Understanding the Data

## Data Quality & Reliability

This data comes from **provider self-reporting to the FCC**, which means:

- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of regulated broadband providers
- ✅ Standardized reporting format across all providers
- ⚠️ Data represents claimed availability, not verified service or actual customer connections
- ⚠️ Updates occur only twice per year, so recent changes may not be reflected

<Warning>
Always interpret this data as "claimed service availability" rather than guaranteed service. Actual service availability at specific addresses may differ.
</Warning>
