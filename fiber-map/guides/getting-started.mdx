## Access Requirements

- Snowflake account with access to `FIBER_MAP` database
- Appropriate permissions on `DBT_GOLD` schema

## Quick Start

### Connect to Snowflake

```sql
USE DATABASE FIBER_MAP;
USE SCHEMA DBT_GOLD;
```

### Verify Access

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_RECORDS,
    COUNT(DISTINCT LOCATION_ID) AS UNIQUE_LOCATIONS,
    MIN(TIME_PERIOD_DATE) AS EARLIEST_DATE,
    MAX(TIME_PERIOD_DATE) AS LATEST_DATE
FROM usa_all_periods_final;
```

### Basic Query Example

```sql
SELECT 
    TECHNOLOGY_NAME,
    COUNT(DISTINCT LOCATION_ID) AS LOCATIONS
FROM usa_location_summary
WHERE TIME_PERIOD = 'June 2023'
    AND TECHNOLOGY_NAME != 'All'
GROUP BY TECHNOLOGY_NAME
ORDER BY LOCATIONS DESC;
```

## Important Notes

- Always use `DISTINCT` when counting locations
- Filter synthetic "All" rows: `WHERE TECHNOLOGY_NAME != 'All'`
- Use `TIME_PERIOD_DATE` for date filtering
- No assumed referential integrity - use LEFT JOINs
