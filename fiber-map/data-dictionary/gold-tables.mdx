### Synthetic "All" Technology Rows

This table includes special rows where `TECHNOLOGY_NAME = 'All'` for each location, brand, and time period combination. These rows enable Lightdash dashboards to show "all technologies" as a filter option without creating duplicate counts.

**When to exclude**: Filter out `TECHNOLOGY_NAME = 'All'` when you need actual technology breakdowns or when joining to other tables.

**When to keep**: When building Lightdash dashboards that use technology as a parameter filter.

### Analysis in Lightdash

Use this table for fast location counting and market share analysis. It's optimized for performance and works best with the `NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS` and `PERCENT_OF_LOCATIONS` metrics.
