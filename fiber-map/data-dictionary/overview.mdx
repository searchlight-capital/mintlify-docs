## Introduction

This data dictionary provides comprehensive documentation of all tables and fields available in the Fiber Map dataset. Each field includes its definition, data type, business meaning, and sample values where applicable.

## Available Tables

The Fiber Map project includes data organized across multiple layers. For most business analysis, you'll work with the **Gold Layer** tables.

### Gold Layer (Analysis-Ready Tables)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="usa_all_periods_final" icon="table" href="/fiber-map/data-dictionary/gold-tables#usa_all_periods_final">
    **Full detail table** with provider, technology, speeds, and geographic information
    
    - ~50M records (Indiana sample)
    - Location + Provider + Technology + Time grain
    - Includes speed tiers and DOCSIS classifications
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="usa_location_summary" icon="table-list" href="/fiber-map/data-dictionary/gold-tables#usa_location_summary">
    **Aggregated summary** optimized for location counting and market share
    
    - ~5-10M records (Indiana sample)
    - Location + Provider + Technology + Time grain
    - Includes synthetic "All" technology rows
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Clean Layer (Source Data)

<Card title="USA_ALL_PERIODS_FINAL" icon="database" href="/fiber-map/data-dictionary/clean-tables">
  **Raw FCC data** with 2.5 billion records
  
  - Full US dataset, not typically used by analysts
  - Source of truth for all downstream tables
</Card>

## Table Selection Guide

Choose the right table for your analysis needs:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I need location counts and market share" icon="chart-pie">
    **Use**: `usa_location_summary`
    
    This table is optimized for counting distinct locations and calculating market share. It's faster than the detail table and perfect for dashboard visualizations.
    
    Example: "How many locations does Comcast serve?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I need speed information (Mbps)" icon="gauge-high">
    **Use**: `usa_all_periods_final`
    
    This table includes download and upload speed fields. Use it when you need to analyze speed tiers or compare provider offerings.
    
    Example: "What percentage of locations have gigabit download speeds?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I need DOCSIS version information for cable" icon="tower-broadcast">
    **Use**: `usa_all_periods_final`
    
    The detail table includes DOCSIS classification (2.0/3.0, 3.1, 4.0) derived from speed information.
    
    Example: "How many cable locations support DOCSIS 4.0?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I need business vs. residential breakdown" icon="building">
    **Use**: `usa_all_periods_final`
    
    The detail table includes a Business/Residential code indicating service type availability.
    
    Example: "Which providers offer business-class service?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I need census block geographic detail" icon="map-location-dot">
    **Use**: `usa_all_periods_final`
    
    The detail table includes census block GEOID for precise geographic analysis.
    
    Example: "Show me fiber availability by census block."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I need build-out timeline analysis" icon="calendar">
    **Use**: `usa_all_periods_final`
    
    The detail table includes BUILD_DATE showing when each provider+technology first became available at each location.
    
    Example: "When did Provider X start offering fiber in this market?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I'm building a Lightdash dashboard" icon="chart-mixed">
    **Use**: `usa_location_summary` (for most dashboards)
    
    The summary table is optimized for interactive dashboards and includes parameter-friendly synthetic rows.
    
    Use the detail table only if you need speeds or other detailed attributes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

- **TECHNOLOGY_NAME**: Human-readable name (e.g., "Fiber to the Premises", "Cable")
- **DOCSIS_CLASS**: Cable technology version (4.0, 3.1, 2.0/3.0)

### Service Attributes
- **MAX_ADVERTISED_DOWNLOAD_SPEED**: Download speed in Mbps
- **MAX_ADVERTISED_UPLOAD_SPEED**: Upload speed in Mbps
- **LOW_LATENCY**: Low latency indicator (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **BUSINESS_RESIDENTIAL_CODE**: Service type (B, R, or X)

### Geographic Dimensions
- **STATE**: State name
- **COUNTY**: County name
- **ZCTA**: ZIP Code Tabulation Area
- **BLOCK_GEOID**: Census block identifier

## How to Navigate This Dictionary

1. **Start with the table you need**: Use the Table Selection Guide above
2. **Browse by layer**: Gold tables for analysis, Clean layer for reference
3. **Review field definitions**: Each field includes description, type, and usage notes
4. **Check sample values**: Many fields include top values or distributions to help you understand the data

## Data Conventions

### Naming Standards

- All column names use **UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORED** format
- Prefixes indicate layer: no prefix for Gold, `stg_` for Stage, `mdl_` for Model
- Date fields use descriptive names ending in `_DATE` (e.g., `BUILD_DATE`, not `DATE_BUILD`)

### NULL Values

- Most fields allow NULLs except primary keys
- NULL typically indicates the field is not applicable to that record
- Example: `DOCSIS_CLASS` is NULL for non-cable technologies

### Data Types

- **String**: Text fields (brand names, technology names, codes)
- **Number**: Integers (location IDs, provider IDs, speeds, technology codes)
- **Date**: Date values (time period dates, build dates)
