## Overview

The Fiber Map dataset implements comprehensive data quality controls to ensure reliability and accuracy. This page explains the quality assurance framework, sampling methodology, and known limitations of the data.

## Data Quality Controls

### Primary Key Uniqueness Tests

All Gold layer tables enforce strict uniqueness on primary keys using dbt tests.

**Tables tested**:
- `usa_all_periods_final`: Composite MD5 hash of all identifying fields
- `usa_location_summary`: Composite MD5 hash of time + brand + technology + location

**Test definition**:
```yaml
columns:
  - name: primary_key
    tests:
      - unique
      - not_null
```

**What this ensures**:
- No duplicate rows in the table
- Every row has a valid primary key
- Data integrity at the grain level

**When tests run**: Every time the dbt model is executed (on each pipeline run)

### NOT NULL Tests

Critical identifier fields are tested to ensure they always contain values:

**Fields tested**:
- PRIMARY_KEY
- LOCATION_ID (indirectly via primary key composition)
- BRAND_NAME (indirectly via primary key composition)
- TIME_PERIOD (indirectly via primary key composition)

**Purpose**: Prevent records with missing key identifying information from entering the Gold layer
