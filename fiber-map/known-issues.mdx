## Known Limitations

### Provider Self-Reported Data

**Issue**: All data comes from provider self-reporting to the FCC, with no independent verification.

**Impact**:
- Providers may overstate coverage areas
- "Availability" claims may not reflect actual service capability
- Speed claims represent "up to" speeds, not guaranteed minimums
- No validation of service quality or customer experience

**Recommendation**: 
- Use data for strategic analysis, market trends, and competitive intelligence
- Do not use as definitive proof of service availability at specific addresses
- Cross-reference with other data sources when precision is critical

---

### No Verification of Actual Service

**Issue**: Data represents claimed availability, not actual customer connections or verified service.

**What "availability" means**:
- Provider claims they *could* serve the location
- Does not mean service is currently active
- Does not mean a customer is subscribed
- May require additional infrastructure investment to actually connect

**Business implication**:
- ✅ Suitable for: Market sizing, technology penetration, competitive footprint analysis
- ⚠️ Not suitable for: Individual address service validation, precise customer count estimates

**Workaround**: For precise address-level verification, use provider-specific address qualification tools or field surveys.

---

### Referential Integrity Not Guaranteed

**Issue**: The dataset may contain orphaned records or inconsistent references between tables.

**Examples**:
- Location IDs in one table may not exist in another
- Provider IDs may be inconsistent across time periods
- Geographic codes may not match to standard census geographies

**Best practice**: 
- **Always use LEFT JOINs** in Lightdash or when writing SQL to avoid accidentally dropping records
- Include NULL checks when filtering on joined fields
- Validate row counts before and after joins

---

### Semi-Annual Update Frequency

**Issue**: Data is only collected twice per year (June and December), creating gaps in coverage.

**Impact**:
- Recent provider expansions may not be visible for 3-6 months
- Mid-year changes are not captured
- BUILD_DATE field shows "first reported" not "actual build date"

**Current data availability**:
- June data: Released in July-August
- December data: Released in January-February

**Mitigation**: 
- Use BUILD_DATE cautiously, understanding it reflects first FCC report date
- Note the reporting period when communicating insights ("as of December 2024")
- Supplement with provider announcements for recent changes

---

### Geographic Precision Limitations

**Issue**: Location-level data does not always correspond to exact street addresses.

**Details**:
- LOCATION_ID maps to FCC's Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric
- Some rural areas may have imprecise location mappings
- Census block is the finest geographic grain available
- ZIP codes (ZCTA) are census approximations, not postal ZIP codes

**Best for**:
- County-level analysis
- Census block analysis
- Regional comparisons

**Not suitable for**:
- Exact street address validation
- Sub-block geographic precision

---

### Gold Layer is Sampled

**Issue**: The Gold layer contains only a 2% sample of Indiana locations.

**Impact**:
- Absolute location counts are understated by ~50x
- Small providers or rare technology combinations may be under-represented
- Very specific geographic areas (single census blocks) may not be represented

**When this matters**:
- Precise absolute counts (multiply by 50 to estimate, or query Clean layer)
- Analysis of small providers with limited footprint
- Single census block-level analysis

**When this doesn't matter**:
- Proportional analysis (market share, technology mix)
- Provider comparisons
- Trend analysis over time

**Solution**: For precision, query the **Clean layer** (`FIBER_MAP.CLEAN.USA_ALL_PERIODS_FINAL`)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do some locations show multiple providers?" icon="circle-question">
    **Answer**: This is normal and expected! One location can be served by multiple broadband providers using different technologies.
    
    For example, a single address might have:
    - Comcast (Cable)
    - AT&T (Fiber)
    - T-Mobile (Fixed Wireless)
    - Starlink (Satellite)
    
    This is captured in the dataset by having multiple rows per location, each representing a different provider-technology combination.
    
    **Analysis tip**: To count locations (not provider-location combinations), always use `COUNT(DISTINCT LOCATION_ID)`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Business and Residential service?" icon="building">
    **Answer**: The BUSINESS_RESIDENTIAL_CODE field indicates service availability:
    
    - **R** = Residential customers only (home internet)
    - **B** = Business customers only (commercial service)
    - **X** = Both business and residential customers
    
    **Key differences**:
    - **Residential**: Consumer-grade service, residential pricing, best-effort SLA
    - **Business**: Commercial-grade service, SLAs, dedicated support, higher pricing
    
    Many providers offer the same technology to both markets but differentiate by service level and pricing.
    
    **Analysis tip**: To include residential service, filter to `BUSINESS_RESIDENTIAL_CODE IN ('R', 'X')`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How often is the data updated?" icon="calendar-days">
    **Answer**: The FCC collects broadband data **semi-annually**:
    
    - **June reporting period**: Data released in July-August
    - **December reporting period**: Data released in January-February
    
    The Gold layer is refreshed within 1-2 weeks of each FCC data release.
    
    **Implication**: Changes that occur between reporting periods are not captured. If a provider expands in March, it won't appear until the June reporting period (released in July-August).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Why is only Indiana in the Gold layer?" icon="map">
    **Answer**: The Gold layer currently contains a 2% sample filtered to Indiana to optimize query performance and focus on an initial target market.
    
    **For Indiana analysis**: Use Gold layer (fast, optimized)
    **For national analysis**: Use Clean layer (`FIBER_MAP.CLEAN.USA_ALL_PERIODS_FINAL`)
    
    The full national dataset is available in the Clean layer with all 50 states and 2.5 billion records.
    
    **Future plans**: Additional geographies may be added to Gold layer based on business needs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I trust the speed information?" icon="gauge-high">
    **Answer**: Speed information should be interpreted as "maximum advertised speeds," not guaranteed performance.
    
    **What speeds represent**:
    - Provider's claimed maximum speed capability
    - "Up to" speeds, not minimums or averages
    - Theoretical maximum under ideal conditions
    - No verification or testing performed
    
    **What speeds do NOT represent**:
    - Actual customer experience
    - Average speeds
    - Guaranteed minimums
    - Speed during peak usage times
    
    **Use cases**:
    - Compare relative speed offerings between providers
    - Identify gigabit-capable infrastructure
    - Track speed increases over time
    - Classify service tiers
    
    **Don't use for**: Actual performance validation or customer QoS analysis
  </Accordion>

### Data Analysis Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I count unique locations correctly?" icon="hashtag">
    **Answer**: Use the pre-configured `NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS` metric in Lightdash, which automatically counts distinct locations.
    
    **Why**: One location appears in multiple rows due to different providers, technologies, time periods, and service types. The metric handles this correctly.
    
    **In Lightdash**: Simply add the `NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS` metric to your query and group by the dimensions you need (e.g., `BRAND_NAME`, `TECHNOLOGY_NAME`).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I use usa_all_periods_final or usa_location_summary?" icon="table">
    **Answer**: Depends on what you need:
    
    **Use usa_all_periods_final when you need**:
    - Speed information (download/upload Mbps)
    - DOCSIS classification
    - Business vs. residential breakdown
    - Census block detail
    - Build dates
    
    **Use usa_location_summary when you need**:
    - Simple location counts
    - Market share calculations
    - Faster query performance
    - Lightdash dashboards
    - Provider footprint analysis
    
    **Rule of thumb**: If you only need to count locations by provider/technology/time, use the summary table. If you need detailed attributes, use the detail table.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are the 'All' technology rows in usa_location_summary?" icon="layer-group">
    **Answer**: These are **synthetic rows** added to support Lightdash parameter filtering.
    
    For each location + brand + time period, the table includes:
    - One row for each actual technology (Cable, Fiber, etc.)
    - One synthetic row with TECHNOLOGY_NAME = 'All'
    
    **Purpose**: Enables Lightdash users to filter by "All Technologies" without creating duplicate counts.
    
    **Important**: When you need actual technology breakdowns in Lightdash, filter out `TECHNOLOGY_NAME = 'All'` in your query filters.
    
    **When to keep them**: When you want to see aggregated metrics across all technologies.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I calculate market share?" icon="chart-pie">
    **Answer**: Use the `PERCENT_OF_LOCATIONS` metric in Lightdash.
    
    **In Lightdash**:
    1. Add the `PERCENT_OF_LOCATIONS` metric
    2. Group by `BRAND_NAME`
    3. Filter to your desired `TIME_PERIOD`
    
    **Note**: Market share percentages will sum to more than 100% because locations can have multiple providers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I analyze trends over time?" icon="chart-line">
    **Answer**: Use Lightdash's time-series visualization features with the `TIME_PERIOD_DATE` dimension.
    
    **In Lightdash**:
    1. Add `NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS` metric
    2. Group by `TIME_PERIOD_DATE` and `BRAND_NAME`
    3. Filter to specific providers you want to compare
    4. Visualize as a line chart
    
    **Tips**:
    - Use `TIME_PERIOD_DATE` for time-series charts
    - Use `TIME_PERIOD` for readable labels in tables
    - Remember data is semi-annual, so expect 6-month gaps between points
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="The Gold layer shows small numbers. Is this correct?" icon="chart-line-down">
    **Answer**: Yes! The Gold layer contains a **2% sample** of Indiana locations.
    
    **To estimate full Indiana counts**: Multiply the `NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS` metric by 50.
    
    **In Lightdash**: Use table calculations to create a new field that multiplies `NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS * 50` for estimated full counts.
    
    **For precise counts**: Contact the data team for access to the Clean layer (advanced users only).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are some DOCSIS_CLASS values NULL?" icon="signal-stream">
    **Answer**: DOCSIS_CLASS only applies to Cable technology (TECHNOLOGY = 40).
    
    For all other technologies (Fiber, Fixed Wireless, Satellite, Copper), DOCSIS_CLASS is NULL because DOCSIS is specific to cable infrastructure.
    
    **This is correct and expected**. Only filter or group by DOCSIS_CLASS when analyzing cable providers.
    
    **In Lightdash**: Filter to `TECHNOLOGY_NAME = 'Cable'` first, then group by `DOCSIS_CLASS`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What does BUILD_DATE represent?" icon="calendar-check">
    **Answer**: BUILD_DATE is the **first date that provider-technology combination appeared in the FCC dataset**, not necessarily the actual construction date.
    
    **What it means**:
    - First reporting period where provider claimed to serve that location with that technology
    - "First observed" date in the data
    - Earliest period tracked (June 2022)
    
    **What it does NOT mean**:
    - Actual infrastructure construction date
    - Service activation date
    - Customer connection date
    
    **Use for**:
    - Tracking provider expansion patterns
    - Identifying recently entered markets
    - Analyzing build-out timelines
    
    **Limitation**: Data collection started June 2022, so no BUILD_DATE can be earlier than 2022-06-01.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I join Gold tables to external data?" icon="link">
    **Answer**: Yes, using geographic identifiers.
    
    **Join keys available**:
    - **STATE**: State name ("INDIANA")
    - **COUNTY**: County name ("Marion")
    - **ZCTA**: ZIP Code Tabulation Area (5-digit string)
    - **BLOCK_GEOID**: Census block identifier (15-digit string)
    
    **In Lightdash**: Use these geographic dimensions to filter and group data. For external data joins, work with your data team to create joined datasets.
    
    **Note**: When joining tables, use LEFT JOIN patterns to handle potential mismatches in geographic naming conventions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### My query returns no results

**Check**:
1. Are you filtering to a valid TIME_PERIOD?
2. Is the BRAND_NAME spelled correctly (case-sensitive)?
3. For usa_location_summary, did you filter out TECHNOLOGY_NAME = 'All' when you shouldn't have?
4. Are you using the correct schema (DBT_GOLD vs CLEAN)?

### My location counts seem too low

**Explanation**: The Gold layer contains a 2% sample.

**Solution**: Multiply by 50 to estimate full Indiana counts, or query the Clean layer for precise counts.

### My joins are dropping records

**Cause**: Using INNER JOIN without accounting for referential integrity issues.

**Solution**: Use LEFT JOIN patterns in Lightdash or when writing SQL. Work with your data team if you need complex joins between tables.

### My query is very slow

**Causes**:
1. Querying Clean layer without filters
2. Not filtering by TIME_PERIOD
3. Using complex window functions on large result sets

**Solutions**:
1. Use Gold layer instead of Clean when possible
2. Always filter by TIME_PERIOD
3. Add STATE filter when querying Clean layer
4. Use LIMIT for testing
5. Consider SAMPLE() for exploratory analysis
