## Overview

The Fiber Map dataset includes two primary metrics built into the Lightdash semantic layer. These metrics are pre-configured and ready to use in dashboards and analyses.

## Core Metrics

### Number of Locations

**Metric Name**: `NUMBER_OF_LOCATIONS`

**Definition**: Distinct count of broadband service locations

**Calculation**: `COUNT_DISTINCT(LOCATION_ID)`

**Business Context**

This is the fundamental metric for market sizing and coverage analysis. It answers questions like:
- How many locations does Provider X serve?
- What's the size of the addressable market in County Y?
- How many locations have fiber service available?

**Important Notes**

<Warning>
Always use `COUNT(DISTINCT LOCATION_ID)` rather than `COUNT(*)` when counting locations. A single location may have multiple rows due to different providers, technologies, or service types.
</Warning>

### Percent of Locations

**Metric Name**: `PERCENT_OF_LOCATIONS`

**Definition**: Percentage of total locations in the dataset

**Calculation**: `(Location count / Total locations) * 100`
