Prime is a custom MCP server that serves dbt project context (manifest files) to Claude, ensuring AI understands our specific data model.

## Overview

Prime acts as a bridge between your dbt project's metadata and your AI assistant. By indexing the `manifest.json` file, it allows Claude to understand:
*   Table schemas and column descriptions.
*   Metric definitions.
*   Lineage relationships between models.

## Admin Setup

(Coming soon: Instructions for deploying Prime to a new environment).

## User Setup (Claude.ai)

1.  **Locate the Prime URL**: Ask your admin for the internal URL where Prime is hosted (currently http://prime-f15k.onrender.com/).
2.  **Configure Claude**: Navigate to **Settings** > **Connectors** > **Add custom connector**. Call it Prime. Just enter the URL (no Oauth at this stage)
3.  **Verify**: Ask "Using Prime, tell me which metrics exist in our warehouse"
