Business users can access data through trusted dashboards or ask questions in natural language.

## Method 1: Trusted Dashboards (Lightdash)

Use **Lightdash** for standard, recurring reporting.

1.  Navigate to the Lightdash portal.
2.  Browse "Saved Charts" or "Dashboards" for verified metrics.
3.  Use filters to slice data by date, region, or product.
4.  **Drill down**: Click on data points to inspect underlying records.

## Method 2: Ad-Hoc Analysis (Claude.ai)

Use **Claude** for one-off questions or exploring data not yet in a dashboard.

### Setup
Ensure you have the **Snowflake MCP** integration enabled in your Claude interface.

### Querying Data
1.  **Ask a Question**: "Show me the trend of active fiber subscribers for the last 6 months by region."
2.  **Verify Context**: Claude uses the Snowflake MCP to check the schema. It may ask for clarification on which table to use (e.g., `GOLD_SUBSCRIPTIONS`).
3.  **Get Results**: Claude generates the SQL, runs it against Snowflake, and presents the answer (chart or table).
4.  **Iterate**: "Now break this down by acquisition channel."

### Best Practices
*   Be specific about time ranges.
*   Reference specific business entities (e.g., "Customers", "Invoices") to help Claude find the right tables.
*   Cross-reference critical numbers with Lightdash dashboards.
